%This factor speaks to the originality of the research you are engaged
%in. Are you applying well known techniques and procedures, or
%adapting old methods to new problems, or creating an entirely new
%protocol to attack a research problem?

%
%Describe the creative thinking, analysis, synthesis, evaluation,
%judgment, resourcefulness and insight needed to perform your
%work. Identify existing scientific guides (or knowledge) and indicate
%the degree of applicability (e.g., how available/useful are technical
%handbooks, periodicals, reports, patent disclosures, guidance from
%technical specialists). Also describe the intrinsic difficulty in
%applying available guides to your current assignment?

%Address:
%?	original and independent creation of: research subjects, analysis, reasoning, evaluation, and judgment; and 
%?	originality in interpreting findings and translating findings into a form usable by others
%Describe originality (e.g., technical judgment, creativity, resourcefulness) needed to fill in, adapt, or extend theories, methods, and techniques.

%If you use established techniques for your field describe how you are applying those techniques to complex and original questions/problems.

This factor deals with the creative thinking, analysis, synthesis,
evaluation, judgment, resourcefulness, and insight characterizing the
work currently performed.\\

Guidelines usually consist of literature in the field, procedures,
instructions, or precedents and may be adapted or modified to meet the
requirements of the current assignment.
Features to be considered are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the extent and nature of available written guides; 
\item intrinsic difficulty encountered in applying guides in terms of
  their ready adaptability to the current assignment; and
\item the degree of judgment required in selecting, interpreting, and
  adapting guidelines.
\end{itemize}
In assessing the impact of creativity in the position, consider the requirement for: 
\begin{itemize}
\item original and independent creation, analysis, reasoning,
  evaluation, and judgment; and
\item originality in interpreting findings and translating findings
  into a form usable by others.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Factor 3 -- Degree Level A (2 points)}

Guideline include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item existing theories and methods generally applicable to the research problem; or
  \item materials that may contain some inconsistencies, be partially defined, or provide several possible approaches to the problem. 
\end{itemize}

Originality is demonstrated by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item developing a complete and adequate research design by selecting and adapting the most appropriate approach, methods, or techniques for the problem at hand; and
  \item limited extension or modification of procedures or techniques, as required.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Factor 3 -- Degree Level C (6 points)}

Guidelines:
\begin{itemize}
  \item consist of existing literature in the field of limited usefulness due to contradictions, critical 
  gaps, or limited applicability; or
  \item are largely absent because of the novel nature of the work. 
\end{itemize}

Originality is demonstrated by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item defining elusive or highly complex problems;
  \item developing productive hypotheses for testing;
  \item developing important new approaches, methods, and techniques;
  \item interpreting and relating significant results to other research findings; 
  \item developing and applying new techniques and original methods of attack to solve important problems presenting unprecedented or novel aspects;
  \item isolating and defining critical problem features; and
  \item adapting, extending, and synthesizing theory, principles, and techniques into original or innovative combinations or configurations. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Factor 3 -- Degree Level E (10 points)}

Guidelines are almost nonexistent in pertinent literature.\\
Originality and creativity are demonstrated by:

\begin{itemize}
\item discovering complex theory or methodology; 
\item contributing significantly to the development of new theory or methodology to supplant or 
add new dimensions to a previous framework; and 
\item solving problems and delivering results that markedly influence the scientific field or society.
\end{itemize}
